# Training and Placement Systems

## About Project
This web application serves as a valuable platform developed using the C# language and .Net framework. It is designed to cater to the needs of students, universities (particularly the Training and Placement Officers of colleges), and company recruiters. The primary purpose of this portal revolves around facilitating efficient campus recruitment processes.

For universities and colleges, the portal empowers TPOs to effortlessly communicate upcoming company visits for recruitment. Students can access comprehensive details about these opportunities, including information about the companies, available roles, responsibilities, salary structures, eligibility criteria, past cut-off scores, and even apply directly through the portal. Following the recruitment events, the portal also facilitates the announcement of results.

In addition to recruitment-related features, the portal provides a communication channel for university professors to share important notices with specific batches of students. Graduates from previous years can contribute by sharing their valuable experiences working at various companies, thereby providing insights to current students.

In essence, this portal effectively streamlines the process of managing placements, benefitting students, universities, and recruiters alike.
